# Software Engineer (Full Stack and Backend Roles Available) - Central London, UK
[![StackShare](https://img.shields.io/badge/tech-stack-0690fa.svg?style=flat)](https://stackshare.io/salestrip/salestrip)

We're looking for software engineers to help build the foundations (and beyond!) of the SalesTrip Engine. You will ideally be someone with deep technical roots, and that is excited at the prospect of working with new technologies. In this role, you will own the development process of specific features in our SaaS offering. You'll engage in problem analysis and create feature plans that outline implementation details. You'll code and build features in ad-hoc, cross-functional feature teams. You'll work in a full CI/CD environment, at a sustainable pace in our ongoing Kanban-driven process. You'll take part in maintaining and supporting our service. You will report to Sid, the Lead Architect of this platform area.

## Responsibilities
### Participate in feature design
With our product and UX requirements at hand, you will take part in solution design. We believe that done is better than perfect. We iterate quite fast with a completely continuous deployment pipeline. You and your feature team will create a plan by combining the product requirements with the system's architecture. After a short review and collaboration with the relevant people you will then begin building your feature!

### Code
As you may have guessed, most of your time will be spent coding ü§ì We are a small group (for now), but plan to keep our team structure flat, flexible and multi-functional. Our Kanban process means we have fewer meetings and devote more of our time to building the platform - once you're done with the build-test-deploy components of your feature you simply grab the next card from the top of the pile.

### Engage with our Product Owners and other key stakeholders

Our team includes some of the best industry experts and working with them helps us understand our target customers better, as well as identify the product's pain points. The feedback loop into our requirements gathering process is immediate.

- You will be key in technology selection, and platform architecture design
- You will jointly design our microservices architecture and resultant APIs
- You will lead the engineering methodology in the SalesTrip Engine area, ensuring our adherence to modern design, build and test principles
- You will be hands-on, developing software with the other early tech hires including the CTO
- The company will grow rapidly. You be essential to the hiring process as well as being a tech lead as the team grows

## Skills & Experience
### Required

Ideally you will have a proven track record working on scalable web applications within a lean agile environment, comfortable working on the latest tech stacks, with a strong focus on quality and delivery.

- Have a demonstrable track record of building mission-critical web applications
- Extensive experience with JavaScript, ES2015 (ES6), ES2016 (ES7)+
- Node.js application development experience
- Experience with and appreciation for Test Driven Development
- A love for writing clean, efficient, readable code
- Experience working in cross-functional delivery teams
- Full command of Git
- Excellent communication skills and self-initiative

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Google Cloud Platform

- RxJS
- TypeScript
- Familiarity with microservice or service based architectures
- Experience with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

# A bit more about SalesTrip
## SalesTrip Vision
"Travel and Expense" is a multi-billion dollar industry dominated by behemoths who haven't innovated in a decade or more. We are building an end-to-end, SaaS Travel and Expense (T&E) platform, and will own this market within the next 5 years by fundamentally changing the way the industry works. Our tech stack is cutting edge (e.g. AI, Google Cloud, Kubernetes) and will deliver a user experience unmatched by anything available today. The opportunity is huge, SalesTrip will facilitate proactive functional capabilities in the T&E area that aren't yet being dreamt about, whilst also massively reduce operating costs.

SalesTrip is well funded, and several members of the founding team have previously built and sold amazing companies (making our ex-employees a lot more wealthy in the process). Our people are some of the most recognised within their respective areas, from technology through to industry experience and we're determined to succeed - ultimately changing the way the entire industry works.

## Our Business Right Now
We hired our first employees in August 2017 and so are still fairly young! This provides an incredible opportunity for early joiners, high-growth startups accelerate your career like no other business. So far we employ 9 people across the US and UK, with London being the HQ of our operations. The technical team (there are 4 of us) all work in an office halfway between Angel and Old Street stations, and have spent for the first few months of the year designing the foundation of our platform. We've recently moved into development and are now looking for ambitious individuals who will help us design and build out the SalesTrip platform.

## Tech Stack ü§ñ
The breadth and depth of our intended platform is enormous, a SaaS offering that will need to scale to hundreds-of-thousands of business users. This is reflected in our [choice of technology](https://stackshare.io/salestrip/salestrip), although we expect this to evolve as we design and build.

## Interviewing & Hiring
[We're looking for mid-level to senior Full Stack and Backend developers](https://github.com/SalesTrip/jobs/blob/master/Software%20Engineer.md) to join us in our London HQ. If you're successful you could get through our entire interview process in a week or less, here are the highlights:

1. Introductory meeting with Wes (CTO) to understand if you're a good match for us, and we're a good match for you!
2. A short coding exercise (2 hours max).
3. A face-to-face discussion where we discuss your code and understand how you like to get things done.
4. The Offer‚Ñ¢ - we present you with 3 packages that allow you to decide the amount of equity vs salary you'd like to sign up to.
5. You join the team üëèüèº
