# A bit more about SalesTrip
## SalesTrip Vision
"Travel and Expense" is a multi-billion dollar industry dominated by behemoths who haven't innovated in a decade or more. We are building an end-to-end, SaaS Travel and Expense (T&E) platform, and will own this market within the next 5 years by fundamentally changing the way the industry works. Our tech stack is cutting edge (e.g. AI, Docker Swarm) and will deliver a user experience unmatched by anything available today. The opportunity is huge, SalesTrip will facilitate proactive functional capabilities in the T&E area that aren't yet being dreamt about, whilst also massively reduce operating costs.

SalesTrip is well-funded, and several members of the founding team have previously built and sold amazing companies. Our people are some of the most recognised within their respective areas, from technology through to industry experience, and in just over a year we've managed to create a huge stir in the market.

## Our Business Right Now
We hired our first employees in June 2017 and so are still fairly young! This provides an incredible opportunity for early joiners - high-growth startups accelerate your career like no other business. So far we employ 16 people across the US and UK, with London being the HQ of our operations. The technical team (there are 8 of us) all work in an office halfway between Angel and Old Street stations. We're now looking for ambitious individuals who will help us design and build out the SalesTrip platform.

## Tech Stack ü§ñ
The breadth and depth of our intended platform is enormous, a SaaS offering that will need to scale to hundreds-of-thousands of business users. This is reflected in our choice of technology, although we expect this to evolve as we design and build.

## Interviewing & Hiring
We're looking for senior engineers to join us in our London HQ. Our interview process can be completed in a week or less, here are the highlights:

1. Introductory meeting with Wes (CTO) to understand if you're a good match for us, and we're a good match for you!
