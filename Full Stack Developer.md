# Full Stack Developer - Central London, UK
We're looking for a Full Stack Developer to help build the foundations (and beyond!) of the SalesTrip Engine. You will ideally be someone with deep technical roots, and that is excited at the prospect of working with new technologies. In this role, you will own the development process of specific features in our SaaS offering. You'll engage in problem analysis and create feature plans that outline implementation details. You'll code and build features in ad-hoc, cross-functional feature teams. You'll work in a full CI/CD environment, at a sustainable pace in our ongoing Kanban-driven process. You'll take part in maintaining and supporting our service. You will report to the Lead Architect of this platform area.

## Responsibilities
### Participate in feature design
With our product and UX requirements at hand, you will take part in solution design. We believe that done is better than perfect. We iterate quite fast with a completely continuous deployment pipeline. You and your feature team will create a plan by combining the product requirements with the system's architecture. After a short review and collaboration with the relevant people you will then begin building your feature!

### Code
As you may have guessed, most of your time will be spent coding ðŸ¤“ We are a small group (for now), but plan to keep our team structure flat, flexible and multi-functional. Our Kanban process means we have fewer meetings and devote more of our time to building the platform - once you're done with the build-test-deploy components of your feature you simply grab the next card from the top of the pile.

### Engage with our Product Owners and other key stakeholders

Our team includes some of the best industry experts and working with them helps us understand our users better, and identify the product's pain points. The feedback loop into our requirements gathering process is immediate.

- You will be key in technology selection, and platform architecture design
- You will jointly design our microservices architecture and resultant APIs
- You will lead the engineering methodology in the SalesTrip Engine area, ensuring our adherence to modern design, build and test principles
- You will be hands-on, developing software with the other early tech hires including the CTO
- The company will grow rapidly. You be essential to the hiring process as well as being a tech lead as the team grows

# About SalesTrip
"Travel and Expenses" is a multi-billion dollar industry dominated by one major player with software that should've been retired in the early 00s. SalesTrip will topple the current king.

Our SaaS offering will have two major components, CRM and the SalesTrip Engine. The bigger of these will be the SalesTrip Engine - a powerful, scalable cloud-based beast built using best-of-breed technology. The engine encompasses a number of microservices hosted on Google Container Engine making our stack 100% cloud-based and instantly scalable.

The SalesTrip technology team is based in central London, although some of our product management team are based state-side. We use Slack, Jira, Confluence and Google tech to collaborate across the team, drive our sprints and other Agile ceremonies.

We are now looking to grow our development team by adding a Full Stack developer that loves a challenge. Take a look the job description below and get in touch if it's something you could be interested in!
