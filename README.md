"Travel and Expenses" is a multi-billion dollar industry dominated by one major player with software that should've been retired in the early 00s. SaleTrip will change that.

No business out there has a single consolidated view of their T&E expenditure, or the return on investment. Larger companies spend many millions every year on getting a view on this from a financial perspective. The opportunity is enormous, SalesTrip will massively reduce operating costs, whilst also facilitating proactive capabilities in the T&E area that aren't yet even being dreamt about.

Our stack is 100% cloud, using the best-of-breed to build a massively scalable platform for global use. NodeJS, Salesforce, Containers, and Kubernetes are just some of the major parts in our product landscape, and we need brilliant people to help us design and build our disruptive platform.

SalesTrip is well funded, and several members of the founding team have previously built and sold amazing companies. Our people are some of the most recognised within their respective areas, from technology through to industry experience we're determine to success and topple the current monopoly - ultimately changing the way the entire industry works.

We're always on the lookout for people to join us - so if you love technology, and want to help us shape future within this industry please get in touch!
