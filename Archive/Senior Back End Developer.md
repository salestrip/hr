"Travel and Expenses" is a multi-billion dollar industry dominated by one major player with software that should've been retired in the early 00s. SalesTrip will topple the current king.

Our SaaS offering will have two major components, CRM and the SalesTrip Engine. The bigger of these will be the SalesTrip Engine - a powerful, scalable cloud-based beast built using best-of-breed technology. The engine encompasses a number of microservices hosted on Google Container Engine making our stack 100% cloud-based and instantly scalable.

The SalesTrip technology team is based in central London, working out of WeWork offices although some of our product definition team are based state-side. We use Slack, Jira, Confluence and Google tech to collaborate across the team, drive our sprints and other Agile ceremonies.

What we need now is our third tech hire who will ultimately own the design and build of the SalesTrip Engine. Take a look the job description below and get in touch if it's something you could be interested in!
