# Salesforce Developer

SalesTrip is building the most intelligent Travel & Expense platform on Earth, and we need another Salesforce Developer to join us on this adventure! You will be working with two Salesforce Certified Technical Architects, using the most cutting edge Salesforce technologies to expand our Managed Package Salesforce application.

In this role you will own the development of specific features in our Salesforce offering, and you'll code and build features in ad-hoc, cross-functional feature teams. You'll work in a full CI/CD environment using SFDX, at a sustainable pace in our ongoing Kanban-driven process.

## Responsibilities
#### Participate in feature design
You will have immediate access to two CTAs to guide you through the feature design process, and depending on your ambitions, could eventually take on the design responsibility at various application levels.

#### Create Code
As you may have guessed, most of your time will be spent coding ðŸ¤“ We love Lightning and Salesforce DX, and working with the most cutting-edge technologies. You would be working on a range of technology solutions including integration AI into the SalesTrip platform.
Additionally, our Kanban process means we have fewer meetings and devote more of our time to doing what we love, writing code.

# About SalesTrip
"Travel and Expenses" is a multi-billion dollar industry that hasnâ€™t changed in decades. All current T&E platforms are expensive, difficult to implement and use, and built on antiquated technology. The market is ripe for a new technology leader, SalesTrip is that leader.

Our SaaS offering will have two major components, the Salesforce Managed Package and the SalesTrip Engine. The Salesforce Application will use the latest technology to expose Travel & Expense functionality (including AI) to end users, providing value in ways never dreamt of before.

The SalesTrip technology team is based in central London, although some of our product management team are based state-side. We use Slack, Jira, Confluence and Google tech to collaborate across the team, drive our Agile ceremonies.
